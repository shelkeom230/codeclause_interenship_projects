# Mail Sender

- I developed a simple mail sender using **tkinter** and **smtplib** library . I made use of gmail server to send the mails. You can send as many mails as you wan't but the sender email address remains the same.

# Plagarism Checker

- I developed a plagarism checker able to check plagarism on text, numbers and symbol data. I made use of tkinter for GUI and difflib for checking similarity. It shows the match in terms of percentate. If match exceeds **95 %** the plagarism is detected otherwise not.
