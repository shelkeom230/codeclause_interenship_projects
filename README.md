# codeclause_interenship_projects
This repository contains all the project that i have completed as a part of my 1 month virtual interenship here at Codeclause as a python developer student intern. I created some really fascinating projects like Text editor, music player, mail sender, plagarism detector and looking forward to do similar real world applications.
